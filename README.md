# HunterQuest
## A game by Jon Ting, Steven Wang, and Lawrence Hook
## Made for CS 4730 - Game Design at UVa

Hello!  Thanks for reading the readme.  In here, we will describe how to
play the game.  At its current state, it is still a prototype, and as a
result, has very limited functionality.  However, we hope that you will
still enjoy what we have to offer.

To begin the game, simply open index.html from inside the javscript
folder.  This should open the game in a browser window, and you should
be able to restart it by refreshing the page.  Our decision to use
javascript is so that in the future we can embed our game into a website
and increase the scope of people who can access our game.

The goals of the prototype is simply just spawning enemies and defeating
them to accrue gold and experience.  To do this, you shoot bullets at
them while dodging the bullets they shoot at you.  There is no end
condition implemented yet in the game, as it is more of a technical demo
instead of a full fledged game.
